Fabric.js subclasses
====================

Fabric.js (http://http://fabricjs.com/) is a powerful Javascript library that provides a higher-level object-oriented API for working with the HTML5 canvas.

Fabric.js allows you to define your own objects that subclass one of the fabric classes. This is very useful to putting structure to logical architecture/engineering drawings. 
This repository contains a subfolder for all my Fabric.js subclasses (each subfolder has its own README file).
